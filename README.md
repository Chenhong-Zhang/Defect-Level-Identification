# Defect-Level-Identification

This repository contains the implementation of the defect level identification model described in the paper:  
**_A Machine Learning Approach for Enhancing Bridge Inspection Data Quality_**.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the organization and execution of the defect level identification model. Due to restrictions on the research data used in the paper, the dataset provided here is for demonstration purposes only. It illustrates how to structure your training, testing, and validation data for similar tasks.

## Repository Contents

- **`main.py`**: The main script for running the defect level identification model.
- **`configs.json`**: A configuration file for specifying model settings, data paths, and other parameters.
- **Example Dataset**: A demonstration dataset for testing the structure and workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Runing The Model:

First Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Defect-Level-Identification.git
cd Defect-Level-Identification
```

Then run the code:

```bash
python main.py --config configs.json
```
